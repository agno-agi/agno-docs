## Monitoring

Want to monitor and track your Agents?

Agno provides built-in monitoring capabilities that track session and performance metrics through [app.agno.com](https://app.agno.com). To enable monitoring:

1. **Authenticate** (one of these methods):

   - Run `agno setup` in your terminal
   - Export `AGNO_API_KEY=***` in your environment

2. **Enable monitoring** (one of these methods):
   - Set `monitoring=True` when creating an Agent
   - Set `AGNO_MONITOR=true` in your environment

Create a file `monitoring.py` with the following code:

```python monitoring.py
from agno.agent import Agent

agent = Agent(markdown=True, monitoring=True)
agent.print_response("Share a 2 sentence horror story")
```

Run the agent locally and view your sessions at [app.agno.com/sessions](https://app.agno.com/sessions)
