## Monitoring Your Agents

Monitoring helps you track your agents' performance and session activity, ensuring everything runs smoothly. Agno provides built-in monitoring tools that allow you to view session data through [app.agno.com](https://app.agno.com).

## Setup Process

### Step 1: Authenticate

Before enabling monitoring, you need to authenticate using one of these methods:

**Method A: Quick Setup**
```bash
agno setup
```

**Method B: Manual API Key Configuration**
```bash
export AGNO_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

### Step 2: Enable Monitoring

After authentication, enable monitoring using one of these approaches:

**Method A: For a Specific Agent**
```python
agent = Agent(markdown=True, monitoring=True)
```

**Method B: Globally via Environment Variable**
```bash
export AGNO_MONITOR=true
```

### Step 3: Track Your Agent Sessions

Once monitoring is enabled, you can run your agent and view its session data:

1. Create a file `monitoring.py` with this sample code:
   ```python
   from agno.agent import Agent

   agent = Agent(markdown=True, monitoring=True)
   agent.print_response("Share a 2 sentence horror story")
   ```

2. Run your code locally
3. View your sessions at [app.agno.com/sessions](https://app.agno.com/sessions)
