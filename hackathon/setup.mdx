## Environment Setup

Let's get your environment setup for the hackathon. Here are the steps:

1. [Create a virtual environment](#create-a-virtual-environment)
2. [Install libraries](#install-libraries)
3. [Export your API keys](#export-your-api-keys)

### Create a virtual environment

You can use `python3 -m venv` or `uv` to create a virtual environment.

<CodeGroup>

```shell standard python
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

```shell using uv
uv venv --python 3.12
source .venv/bin/activate
```

</CodeGroup>

### Install libraries

Install the `agno` python package along with the models and tools you want to use.

<CodeGroup>

```shell standard python
pip install -U agno openai
```

```shell using uv
uv pip install -U agno openai
```

</CodeGroup>

### Export your API keys

Export the API keys for the models and tools you want to use.

<CodeGroup>

```shell openai
export OPENAI_API_KEY=***
```

```shell gemini
export GOOGLE_API_KEY=***
```

```shell elevenlabs
export ELEVEN_LABS_API_KEY=***
```

</CodeGroup>
