**Agno is a lightweight library for building Multimodal Agents.**

1. Build lightning-fast Agents that work with text, image, audio and video.
2. Add memory, knowledge and tools as needed.
3. Run anywhere, Agno is open-source.

## AI Engineering is Software Engineering

When building AI products, 80% of your solution will be standard python code, and the remaining 20% will use Agents for automation. Agno is designed for such use cases.

Write your AI logic using familiar programming constructs (if, else, while, for) and avoid complex abstractions like graphs and chains. Here's a simple Agent that can search the web:

```python websearch_agent.py
from agno.agent import Agent
from agno.models.openai import OpenAIChat
from agno.tools.duckduckgo import DuckDuckGoTools

agent = Agent(
    model=OpenAIChat(id="gpt-4o"),
    tools=[DuckDuckGoTools()],
    markdown=True
)
agent.print_response("What's happening in New York?", stream=True)
```

## Key features

Agno is designed to be simple, fast and model agnostic. Here are some key features:

- **Lightning Fast**: Agent creation is 10,000x faster than LangGraph (see [performance](https://github.com/agno-agi/agno#performance)).
- **Model Agnostic**: Use any model, any provider, no lock-in.
- **Multi Modal**: Native support for text, image, audio and video.
- **Multi Agent**: Build teams of specialized agents.
- **Memory Management**: Store agent sessions and state in a database.
- **Knowledge Stores**: Use vector databases for RAG or dynamic few-shot.
- **Structured Outputs**: Make Agents respond with structured data.
- **Monitoring**: Track agent sessions and performance in real-time on [agno.com](https://app.agno.com).
