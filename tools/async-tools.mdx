title: Async Tools
---

Agno Agents can execute multiple tools concurrently, allowing you to process function calls that the model makes efficiently. This is especially valuable when the functions involve time-consuming operations. It improves responsiveness and reduces overall execution time.

Here is an example:

```python async_tools.py
import asyncio

from agno.agent import Agent
from agno.models.openai import OpenAIChat
from agno.tools.duckduckgo import DuckDuckGoTools

agent = Agent(
    model=OpenAIChat(id="gpt-4o"),
    tools=[DuckDuckGoTools()],
    show_tool_calls=True,
    markdown=True,
    debug_mode=True,
)
asyncio.run(agent.aprint_response("Whats happening in UK and in USA?"))
```

Run the Agent:

```bash
pip install -U agno openai

export OPENAI_API_KEY=***

python async_tools.py
```

How to use:

1. Provide your Agent with a list of tools, preferably asynchronous for optimal performance. However, standard functions can also be used since they will execute concurrently on a separate thread.
2. Run the Agent using either the `arun` or `aprint_response` function, enabling concurrent execution of tool calls.

<Note>
  Concurrent execution of tools requires a model that is able to request multiple tool
  calls at once.
</Note>

In this example, `gpt-4o` makes two simultaneous tool calls to `DuckDuckGoTools`. Normally these tool calls would execute sequentially, causing delays. However, using the `aprint_response` function, they run concurrently, improving execution time.
