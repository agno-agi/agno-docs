An AI project has the following components:

- Agents
- APIs
- Databases
- Deployment configurations

Agno Workspaces are a container for all the components of your AI project.


including your agents, APIs, databases, and deployment configurations.


To run agents in production, we need to:
1. Serve them using an application like **FastAPI**, **Django** or **Streamlit**.
2. Manage their sessions, memory and knowlege in a database.
3. Monitor, evaluate and improve their performance.

Agno not only makes building Agents easy but also provides templates that can be deployed to AWS with 1 command. Here's how they work:

- Create your codebase using a template: `ag ws create`
- Run your application locally: `ag ws up`
- Run your application on AWS: `ag ws up prd:aws`

<Note>
We strongly believe that data used by AI applications should be stored securely inside your VPC.

We fully support BYOC (Bring Your Own Cloud) and encourage you to use your own AWS account.

## Templates

We recommend starting with the `agent-app` template and adding your own agents.
